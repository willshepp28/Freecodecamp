/**
 * 
 * 
 * Basic JavaScript: Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction
Like the += operator, -= subtracts a number from a variable.

myVar = myVar - 5;

will subtract 5 from myVar. This can be rewritten as:

myVar -= 5;

Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the -= operator.


a should equal 5.

b should equal -6.

c should equal 2.

You should use the -= operator for each variable.

You should not modify the code above the specified comment.
 */



var a = 11;
var b = 9;
var c = 3;

// Only change code below this line
a -= 6;
b -= 15;
c -= 1;
