/**
 * Basic JavaScript: Manipulating Complex Objects
Sometimes you may want to store data in a flexible Data Structure. A JavaScript object is one way to handle flexible data. They allow for arbitrary combinations of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, functions, and objects.

Here's an example of a complex data structure:

var ourMusic = [
  {
    "artist": "Daft Punk",
    "title": "Homework",
    "release_year": 1997,
    "formats": [ 
      "CD", 
      "Cassette", 
      "LP"
    ],
    "gold": true
  }
];
This is an array which contains one object inside. The object has various pieces of metadata about an album. It also has a nested "formats" array. If you want to add more album records, you can do this by adding records to the top level array. Objects hold data in a property, which has a key-value format. In the example above, "artist": "Daft Punk" is a property that has a key of "artist" and a value of "Daft Punk". JavaScript Object Notation or JSON is a related data interchange format used to store data.

{
  "artist": "Daft Punk",
  "title": "Homework",
  "release_year": 1997,
  "formats": [ 
    "CD",
    "Cassette",
    "LP"
  ],
  "gold": true
}
Note
You will need to place a comma after every object in the array, unless it is the last object in the array.

Add a new album to the myMusic array. Add artist and title strings, release_year number, and a formats array of strings.



myMusic should be an array

myMusic should have at least two elements

myMusic[1] should be an object

myMusic[1] should have at least 4 properties

myMusic[1] should contain an artist property which is a string

myMusic[1] should contain a title property which is a string

myMusic[1] should contain a release_year property which is a number

myMusic[1] should contain a formats property which is an array

formats should be an array of strings with at least two elements
