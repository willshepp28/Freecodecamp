 * Basic JavaScript: Nest one Array within Another Array
You can also nest arrays within other arrays, like below:

[["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]]
This is also called a multi-dimensional array.

Create a nested array called myArray.
 * 

 myArray should have at least one array nested within another array.

 // Only change code below this line
var myArray = [[]];
