/**
 * 
 * Basic JavaScript: Appending Variables to Strings
Just as we can build a string over multiple lines out of string literals, we can also append variables to a string using the plus equals (+=) operator.

Example:

var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;
// ourStr is now "freeCodeCamp is awesome!"
Set someAdjective to a string of at least 3 characters and append it to myStr using the += operator.


someAdjective should be set to a string at least 3 characters long.

You should append someAdjective to myStr using the += operator.

// Change code below this line

var someAdjective = "fun";
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";

myStr += someAdjective;
