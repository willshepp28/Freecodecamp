/**
 * Basic JavaScript: Subtract One Number from Another with JavaScript
We can also subtract one number from another.

JavaScript uses the - symbol for subtraction.

Example

myVar = 12 - 6; // assigned 6
Change the 0 so the difference is 12.


    CHALLENGE: 

    - The variable difference should be equal to 12.

    - You should only subtract one number from 45.
 */


var difference = 45 - 33;
