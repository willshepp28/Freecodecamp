/**
 * 
 * Basic JavaScript: Selecting from Many Options with Switch Statements
If you have many options to choose from, use a switch statement. A switch statement tests a value and can have many case statements which define various possible values. Statements are executed from the first matched case value until a break is encountered.

Here is an example of a switch statement:

switch(lowercaseLetter) {
  case "a":
    console.log("A");
    break;
  case "b":
    console.log("B");
    break;
}
case values are tested with strict equality (===). The break tells JavaScript to stop executing statements. If the break is omitted, the next statement will be executed.

Write a switch statement which tests val and sets answer for the following conditions:
1 - "alpha"
2 - "beta"
3 - "gamma"
4 - "delta"




caseInSwitch(1) should have a value of "alpha"

caseInSwitch(2) should have a value of "beta"

caseInSwitch(3) should have a value of "gamma"

caseInSwitch(4) should have a value of "delta"

You should not use any if or else statements

You should have at least 3 break statements

function caseInSwitch(val) {
    var answer = "";
    // Only change code below this line
    switch(val) {
      case 1:
       answer = "alpha";
        break;
      case 2:
        answer = "beta";
        break;
      case 3:
       answer = "gamma";
        break;
      case 4:
        answer = "delta";
        break; 
    }
  
  
    // Only change code above this line
    return answer;
  }
  
  caseInSwitch(1);
