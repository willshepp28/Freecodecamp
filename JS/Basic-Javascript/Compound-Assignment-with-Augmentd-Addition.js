/**
 * 
 * 
 * Basic JavaScript: Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition
In programming, it is common to use assignments to modify the contents of a variable. Remember that everything to the right of the equals sign is evaluated first, so we can say:

myVar = myVar + 5;

to add 5 to myVar. Since this is such a common pattern, there are operators which do both a mathematical operation and assignment in one step.

One such operator is the += operator.

var myVar = 1;
myVar += 5;
console.log(myVar); // Returns 6
Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the += operator.


a should equal 15.

b should equal 26.

c should equal 19.

You should use the += operator for each variable.

You should not modify the code above the specified comment.

var a = 3;
var b = 17;
var c = 12;

// Only change code below this line
a += 12;
b += 9;
c += 7;
