/**
 * 
 * Basic JavaScript: Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication
The *= operator multiplies a variable by a number.

myVar = myVar * 5;

will multiply myVar by 5. This can be rewritten as:

myVar *= 5;

Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the *= operator.


a should equal 25.

b should equal 36.

c should equal 46.

You should use the *= operator for each variable.

You should not modify the code above the specified comment.

var a = 5;
var b = 12;
var c = 4.6;

// Only change code below this line
a = a * 5;
b = 3 * b;
c = c * 10;


a *= 5;
b *= 3;
c *= 10;
