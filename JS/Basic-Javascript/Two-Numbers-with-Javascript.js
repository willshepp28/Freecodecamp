/**
 * 
 * Basic JavaScript: Add Two Numbers with JavaScript
Number is a data type in JavaScript which represents numeric data.

Now let's try to add two numbers using JavaScript.

JavaScript uses the + symbol as an addition operator when placed between two numbers.

Example:

myVar = 5 + 10; // assigned 15
Change the 0 so that sum will equal 20.


    CHALLENGE:

    1. sum should equal 20.

    2. You should use the + operator.
 */



var sum = 10 + 10;
