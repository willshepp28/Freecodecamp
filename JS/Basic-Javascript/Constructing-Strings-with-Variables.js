/**
 * 
 * Basic JavaScript: Constructing Strings with Variables
Sometimes you will need to build a string, Mad Libs style. By using the concatenation operator (+), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.

Example:

var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";
// ourStr is now "Hello, our name is freeCodeCamp, how are you?"
Set myName to a string equal to your name and build myStr with myName between the strings "My name is " and " and I am well!"

myName should be set to a string at least 3 characters long.

You should use two + operators to build myStr with myName inside it.

// Only change code below this line
var myName = "Will";
var myStr = "My name is " + myName + " and I am well!";
