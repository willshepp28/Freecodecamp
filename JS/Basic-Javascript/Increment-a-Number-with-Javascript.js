/**
 * 
 * Basic JavaScript: Increment a Number with JavaScript
You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the ++ operator.

i++;

is the equivalent of

i = i + 1;

Note
The entire line becomes i++;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

Change the code to use the ++ operator on myVar.




    CHALLENGE:

    -  myVar should equal 88.

    - You should not use the assignment operator.

    - You should use the ++ operator.

    - You should not change code above the specified comment.
 */

var myVar = 87;

// Only change code below this line
myVar++;
