/**
 * 
 * 
 * Basic JavaScript: Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator
We can also use the += operator to concatenate a string onto the end of an existing string variable. This can be very helpful to break a long string over several lines.

Note
Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

Example:

var ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";
// ourStr is now "I come first. I come second."
Build myStr over several lines by concatenating these two strings: "This is the first sentence. " and "This is the second sentence." using the += operator. Use the += operator similar to how it is shown in the editor. Start by assigning the first string to myStr, then add on the second string.


myStr should have a value of This is the first sentence. This is the second sentence.

You should use the += operator to build myStr.

 // Only change code below this line

 var myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";

myStr += "This is the second sentence.";
