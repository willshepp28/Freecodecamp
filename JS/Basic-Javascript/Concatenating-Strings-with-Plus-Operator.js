/**
 * 
 * Basic JavaScript: Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator
In JavaScript, when the + operator is used with a String value, it is called the concatenation operator. You can build a new string out of other strings by concatenating them together.

Example

'My name is Alan,' + ' I concatenate.'
Note
Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

Example:

var ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";
// ourStr is "I come first. I come second."
Build myStr from the strings "This is the start. " and "This is the end." using the + operator.



myStr should have a value of This is the start. This is the end.

You should use the + operator to build myStr.

myStr should be created using the var keyword.

You should assign the result to the myStr variable.

var myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end."; // Change this line
